            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <main>
                <p>Hey there! I'm a 22-year-old computer science enthusiast currently navigating the dynamic world of coding and algorithms as a student at the University of Springfield, Illinois. Hailing from the vibrant city of Chicago, I'm on a quest to become a seasoned software engineer/developer, driven by my passion for creating innovative solutions. Beyond the binary realm, you'll often find me unwinding by indulging in my favorite pastimes. Whether it's immersing myself in TV shows, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, exploring the shopping scene, catching the latest blockbuster, or simply cherishing moments with my family and friends, I believe in finding a balance between the digital and real-life adventures that make every day uniquely exciting.</p>
                <a href="#" class="https://www.uis.edu/">University of Springfield Illinois</a>
                <p>In addition to my current endeavors, I'm eagerly gearing up for a new chapter in my academic journey as I prepare to enroll in a 3-semester online master's program in computer science. This upcoming experience is not just about acquiring advanced technical skills; it's a strategic move to deepen my understanding of the field and stay at the forefront of technological innovations. For me, entering the tech realm is not just a career choice; it's an opportunity to be part of a transformative era, contributing to solutions that impact our daily lives. The prospect of bridging theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience is not only important for personal growth but also incredibly exciting as it positions me to be a driving force in shaping the future of technology. As I embark on this academic adventure, the thrill of exploration and the anticipation of learning in a rapidly evolving digital landscape fuel my passion for pursuing a career in tech.</p>
